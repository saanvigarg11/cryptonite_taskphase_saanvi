On checking the program bit by bit, 
for the code,  
```
str w0, [sp, 12]
mov w0, 81
str w0, [sp, 16]
str wzr, [sp, 20]
mov w0, 3
str w0, [sp, 24]
ldr w0, [sp, 20]
ldr w1, [sp, 16]
```  
The user input is stored at `[sp, 12]`.
and the fixed values are intialized as 
`81` is stored at `[sp, 16]`.  
`0` is stored at `[sp, 20]`. (`wzr` stands for "**zero register**". It is a special-purpose register that always holds the value 0)  
`3` is stored at `[sp, 24]`.   
The `mov` command means the value 81 is moved into w0.  
and `[sp, 16]` means `stack + 16`.  

>`ldr` stands for **Load Register**.
>It is used to load data from memory into a register. its used for transferring data between registers and memory.

`ldr	w0, [sp, 20]` Here we are loading 0 (stored at [sp, 20]) to w0 and similarly,  
`ldr	w1, [sp, 16]` 81 to w1.  

Coming to next part of the code,  
```  
lsl	w0, w1, w0
	str	w0, [sp, 28]
	ldr	w1, [sp, 28]
	ldr	w0, [sp, 24]
```
As the hint indicated, we are going to deal with shift operators.  
>Here, `lsl` stands for **Logical Shift Left**. It is used to shift the bits of a register/value to the **left** by a specified no. of positions. 
>All this is equivalent to multiplying the value by **2 to the power n**, where n is the number of positions shifted.  

Syntax: `lsl x,y,z`
which means shift the value in y by z and store the result in x.  
w1 = `[sp, 16]` (81).
w0 = `[sp, 20]` (0).   
So,` lsl w0, w1, w0` means w0 = 81 << 0 = 81.  
store the result at `[sp, 28]`.  

ldr	w1, [sp, 28] loading 81 into w1,    
ldr	w0, [sp, 24] loading 3 into w0.  

Moving to next  
```
sdiv	w0, w1, w0
str	w0, [sp, 28]
ldr	w1, [sp, 28]
ldr	w0, [sp, 12]
```  

>`sdiv` means **signed division**.
Syntax: `sdiv x,y,z`  
Divide y by z and store in x.  

In this case, w1//w0, i.e., 81//3 = 27 stored in w0.[sp, 28]  

Next, loading the value in [sp, 28] to w1, w1=27 and similarly w0=user input.  

The last part of understanding,  
```
sub	w0, w1, w0
str	w0, [sp, 28]
ldr	w0, [sp, 28]
add	sp, sp, 32
ret
```

>`sub` means subtraction.  
Syntax: `sub x, y, z`
y-z and store in x.

Hence w0= 27 - user input, storing the result in stack + 28 and load that result back into w0.  
Return.   

Now, since the result of the subtraction is returned to the `main` function, the program prints `win` if the result is 0.  
Hence, 27âˆ’input=0
which implies that **input=27** .

According to the given flag format, 
converting 27 to hexadecimal, we get **1b**.  
Placing 0s in the starting, we get the following flag:  
**`picoCTF{0000001b}`**
