It included an audio file(`wav` type) with some sound. As the hint suggested, I went on finding about how images are sent from moon 
to the Earth. This website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_11_missing_tapes helped in gaining some clue.  

>**SSTV (Slow Scan Television)** is a method of sending and receiving **still images** using **radio frequencies**. 
>Unlike traditional TV, which transmits many frames per second, SSTV transmits **one image frame at a time**,
>typically over amateur **radio**. Itâ€™s often used by ham radio operators, as in **space communications**,
>like sending images from the International Space Station (ISS).  
>
>In the website, it talked about the **Apollo 11** missing tapes were those that were recorded from
>Apollo 11's SSTV telecast in its **raw format** on telemetry **data tape** at the time of the **first Moon landing** in 1969 and subsequently lost.
>The **data tapes** were used to record all transmitted data (video as well as telemetry) for backup.  
>
>**Telemetry** is the process of remotely collecting and transmitting data from devices, sensors or systems to a central location for monitoring, analysis, and control.
>Its mostly used in industries such as aerospace, environmental monitoring, etc.


Since we were given an audio message, it gave an idea to decode it into an **image**. For that,  
intially I tried using tools like `qsstv` and `pavucontrol` when i searched through this [article](https://ourcodeworld.com/articles/read/956/how-to-convert-decode-a-slow-scan-television-transmissions-sstv-audio-file-to-images-using-qsstv-in-ubuntu-18-04).  
But in my wsl, it kept showing errors like these even after reinstalling this library `libQt5Core.so.5` and updating, etc.  
```
root@DESKTOP-0QGCC7M:/mnt/c/Users/Laptop/Downloads# qsstv
qsstv: error while loading shared libraries: libQt5Core.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory  
root@DESKTOP-0QGCC7M:/mnt/c/Users/Laptop/Downloads# pavucontrol

(pavucontrol:405): Gtk-WARNING **: 20:58:44.536: cannot open display:  
```

So I found some more resources like [this one](https://github.com/colaclanth/sstv/tree/master/sstv) which mentioned the way to convert the file without the use of qsstv, by taking help of 
some Python codes.  
On running the following commands, I finally got the image(`result.png` which got automatically created in my folder) that contained the flag!

This was the image that contained the flag:
