# Binary Exploitation  

## format string 0  

In this challenge, we given a binary code and a source code of C language.

I downloaded both and tried to first convert the binary code to readable format but that wasn't really needed 
as it just contained the lines from the C language code. So I tried executing the program in the terminal using CodeBlocks, which showed this error regarding gid_t:

Then I asked gpt to correct the code to work for me. It just changed those few lines, enabling the code to run atleast.  
```
#ifdef __unix__  // Only include this part for Unix-based systems
    gid_t gid = getegid();
    setresgid(gid, gid, gid);
    #endif  
```
Then, I ran the code, where it asked for choice, starting from first I entered `Breakf@st_Burger`, which showed the following.  
```
Welcome to our newly-opened burger place Pico 'n Patty! Can you help the picky customers find their favorite burger?

I went back and saw the hints which stated to know about format string vulnaribility and also to try out different options. So I went on with `Gr%114d_Cheese`. This time, it accelerated the output.   
Also, if we analyze the C code carefully, we can see that by entering what choice we can move on.
