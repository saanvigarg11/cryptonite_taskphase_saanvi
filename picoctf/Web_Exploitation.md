# Cryptography

## Web Exploitation

### cookies
In this challenge, we were given a website http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/ and we had to find the flag by making
changes in the cookies.

Here, I tried finding the flag first by inspecting and searching the HTML codes or other sources, but 
couldn't find any.

Then, I watched some videos and googled for sources related to changing web page through cookies and getting HTTPS flag.  
Went to the **F12>applications tab> storage> then changed the value from -1 to many numbers.** 
For eg, for value 1, it showed this.

Since it said not very special, I tried for other numbers...  
I thought some hint

It kept showing like this for many numbers, found the limit was only till 28.  
After that, it automatically resets the value back to -1.  

Also tried putting `true` or `admin` in the values section, but there was no display of cookies.
Finally, found the flag in **18**.
