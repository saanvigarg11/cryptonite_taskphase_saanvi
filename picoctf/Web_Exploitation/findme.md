As it said, I entered the username as "test" and the password as "test!" (with an excalamation mark).

It redirected to another web page that looked like this:  
<img width="956" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f3ec5dda-ec50-4bfb-8ba7-ba990c3c887e" />    

On entering something in the search box, it obv showed nothing. So I opened the **Burp Suite**, switched the intercept on after 
entering username and password. On sending the request to the **repeater**, saw some text that seemed to contain something.

The text was this: `cGljb0NURntwcm94aWVzX2Fs`  
Used https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)&input=Y0dsamIwTlVSbnR3Y205NGFXVnpYMkZzIGJGOTBhR1ZmZDJGNVgyRXdabVV3TnpSbWZRPT0  
to convert it to Base64, which then read as **picoCTF{proxies_al**.  

Got half the flag, rest was yet to find. Since the hint indicated about some redirections, I also checked the response of 
the other page.

Here, some text was given: `7b1-0saSQV5P/nyzFi+aDsyr7qbJFk4`   
But on decoding this, nothing useful came out.  
I came back to the home page and saw that in Burp Suite only, a `Follow Redirection` option was present.

On clicking, another response came 
which had the foll text: `bF90aGVfd2F5X2EwZmUwNzRmfQ==`     
TO Base64, we get **l_the_way_a0fe074f}**  
which seemed to be the next part!

Encoding together, I got the final flag.  
**`picoCTF{proxies_all_the_way_a0fe074f}`**
