# Web Exploitation

## cookies
In this challenge, we were given a website http://mercury.picoctf.net:6418/ and we had to find the flag by making
changes in the cookies.

Here, I tried finding the flag first by inspecting and searching the HTML codes or other sources, but 
couldn't find any.

Then, I watched some videos and googled for sources related to changing web page through cookies and getting HTTPS flag.  
Went to the **F12>applications tab> storage> then changed the value from -1 to many numbers.** 
For eg, for value 1, it showed this.

Since it said not very special, I tried for other numbers...  
I thought there might have been some hint, but we had to randomly try out every number.

It kept showing like this for many numbers, found the limit was only till 28.  
After that, it automatically resets the value back to -1.  

Also tried putting `true` or `admin` in the values section, but there was no display of cookies.
Finally, found the flag in **18**.

## Forbidden Paths  
In this challenge, we basically had to get the flag without using absolute paths, i.e we had to use the relative paths (not starting with a `/` symbol).

We were given this website http://saturn.picoctf.net:53830/ and we had to find the flag contained in the flag.txt file.

I proceeded by simply first going into website and searching for the 3 file names mentioned above the search bar. Went through their source codes, but that didn't work. So next using Python or WSL, but that was going typical.

Next I went through some resources, videos and info on accessing files using their relative paths. I got to know how to step up or down using `../../` paths.  

I came to know about **Burp Suite** application that helped targetting the websites, hacking, scan any vulnaribilites, etc. I found this tool really helpful during this challenge. It helped me to change requests/responses between the browser and the server.  

I learnt to use Burp Suite from Google and ChatGPT. Firstly tried to set up a proxy network, but that made all connections unsecured when I was browsing any site, so I just opened **Burp Suite Chromium**, where we can directly target websites.

-Clicked Open Browser in Proxy tab,  
-went to Target tab, right-click > Send to Repeater

-went to the repeater tab and changed the file name to ../flag.txt (making a relative path),  
-clicked on send button to get the modified source code.  
But it showed no file found. So I put one more set of ../../flag.txt, again showed the same msg. On using the name `../../../../flag.txt` in the URL box, I finally got the flag.
