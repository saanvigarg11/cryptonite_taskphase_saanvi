The web page looked like this:

On entering the name of the book(file), the whole story came, which obviously had no sign of a flag.

One more and the easiest option was to directly search the flag.txt file, but the level wasn't that easy.  
So I tried inspecting the source code but it also didn't help.  
So I switched to **Burp Suite** and the **Chromium** browser to open that website. In Burp Suite, I switched on the intercept after searching for the **oliver-twist.txt** 
file.

Then I sent the request to the **Repeater** to investigate the source code further.

Observed that when I wanted to read oliver-twist.txt file, it showed the file name as that and its contents.  
`filename=oliver-twist.txt&read=`. So I decided to change the file name in the inpector panel.

Also since it mentioned not to use absolute paths, I tried using relative paths like `./flag.txt`, or `../flag.txt` but for those it showed no contents exist.  
On using more `./`, like `../../../flag.txt`, it finally showed the flag!!!

The flag is: **`picoCTF{7h3_p47h_70_5ucc355_6db46514}`**
