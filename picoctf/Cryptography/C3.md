Here, we were given a ciphertext and a python encoder for the same to obtain the flag. But it doesn't work by directly executing the code, hence I had to modify it.

I first uploaded the ciphertext and encoder by using **wget** with the link of the documents.  

Then I modified the code by _reversing transformations_ of the variables `lookup1` and `lookup2`, as follows:   
```
import sys
from fileinput import input

chars = ""
for line in input():
    chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0

for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]  
    prev = (cur + prev) % 40

sys.stdout.write(out)
```  

This made the code executable with the output as follows:  
```
root@DESKTOP-0QGCC7M:/mnt/c/Users/Laptop/Downloads# python converts.py < cipher.txt
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```

Now here I took many wrong turns, but finally arrived at the correct one.  
I tried placing the ciphertext given to us in this code, but it had nothing to do with it.  
I also tried converting the program to Python2, as stated in the comments, but that wouldn't work.  
Got outputs like: 
```a
d
l
L
P
J
e
t
```  
which weren't the flag.

Ultimately, we had to write another code similar to the above one, which had to run by opening the above one.  
I saved the above code by **conv.py** and the following code by **converts.py**.  
```
with open('conv.py') as f:
        ciphertext = f.read()
        asciichars = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmn"
        b = 1
        for i in range(len(ciphertext)):
                if i == b*b*b:
                            print(ciphertext[i])
                            b += 1
```
`root@DESKTOP-0QGCC7M:/mnt/c/Users/Laptop/Downloads# python3 converts.py < conv.py`  
This gave the output as follows:  
```
a
d
l
i
b
s
```

That was the flag!!!  

_Overall, this challenge was really confusing._
