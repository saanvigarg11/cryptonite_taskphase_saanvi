Here, we were given a ciphertext and a python encoder for the same to obtain the flag. But it doesn't work by directly executing the code, hence I had to modify it.

I first uploaded the ciphertetx and encoder by using wget with the link of the documents.  

Then I modified the code by _reversing transformations_ of the variables `lookup1` and `lookup2`, as follows:   
```
import sys
from fileinput import input

chars = ""
for line in input():
    chars += line

lookup1 = "\n \"#()*+/1:=[]abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
lookup2 = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTabcdefghijklmnopqrst"

out = ""

prev = 0

for char in chars:
    cur = lookup2.index(char)
    out += lookup1[(cur + prev) % 40]  
    prev = (cur + prev) % 40

sys.stdout.write(out)
```  

This made the code executable with the output as follows:  
```
root@DESKTOP-0QGCC7M:/mnt/c/Users/Laptop/Downloads# python converts.py < cipher.txt
#asciiorder
#fortychars
#selfinput
#pythontwo

chars = ""
from fileinput import input
for line in input():
    chars += line
b = 1 / 1

for i in range(len(chars)):
    if i == b * b * b:
        print chars[i] #prints
        b += 1 / 1
```
