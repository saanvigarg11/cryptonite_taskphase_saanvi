# OASIS CTF 2024  
A competition in which we were required to get the flag by using the hints provided in the decription or in some link.   
We were placed 119 in the list where me and my team mates together contributed to 7 flags. (700 points)

## 1. Welcome  
In this we were just required to copy and paste the flag provided in the description.  

## 2. Flagged  
Here we had to find out the flag in Discord server. I went to the Rules section where in the decription the flag was present.

## 3. Regarding insta post  
The flag was hidden in the recent instagram post description. 

## 4. Ready Player One  
I used a morse-code decoder to find out the flag from the audio given.  
https://databorder.com/transfer/morse-sound-receiver/  
The flag was: `OASIS{M0R5E_M4N1PU7470R}`  

## 5. Arte-Miss  
We had to find the flag in an image. For that I used various techniques like adjusting contrast, mirage etc. But finally I used cyberchef website.  
https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/#recipe=To_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D')From_Base64('A-Za-z0-9%2B/%3D',true,false)  
The flag was: `OASIS{m4ta_af_04515}`  

## 6. This or that?  
A sequence of characters was given here which was a XOR Cipher text: 036363127c7c60001a117c6463170b key - ARTEMIS_WHISPER   
I thought ChatGPT could do this, thus it gave the flag: `OASIS{B17W153_MY573RY}`
 
## 7. String me to sleep  
Here there was a book. So I simply used Ctrl+F and searched for the curly braces {} . Hence,  
the flag was: `OASIS{y0u_fou7d_m3}`  

## 8. Jekylle and Hide!  
In this a link was given where we were supposed to go to the inspect option and then from there I found out the first part of the flag but couldn't find the second part.
First part was: `OASIS{th15_15_part1_`
