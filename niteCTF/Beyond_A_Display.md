Reverse searching this image a lot on Google, I finally found a match.

Opening this [website](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16999809), found out the place to be **Belvedere Towers metro station** in Gurugram, Haryana.  Using [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Belvedere+Towers/@28.491744,77.0881871,3a,75y,90t/data=!3m8!1e2!3m6!1sAF1QipOjGWVSOeXYz5tfpsmeKtPlNK5qMlcuKXXcul9x!2e10!3e12!6shttps:%2F%2Flh5.googleusercontent.com%2Fp%2FAF1QipOjGWVSOeXYz5tfpsmeKtPlNK5qMlcuKXXcul9x%3Dw203-h114-k-no!7i4160!8i2340!4m16!1m8!3m7!1s0x390d1939758e3c3b:0xdb065238a8e7372a!2sBelvedere+Towers!8m2!3d28.49164!4d77.08822!10e5!16s%2Fm%2F0zdqlbb!3m6!1s0x390d1939758e3c3b:0xdb065238a8e7372a!8m2!3d28.49164!4d77.08822!10e5!16s%2Fm%2F0zdqlbb?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI0MTIxMS4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D)

Moving on, the message also said that there was shopping complex nearby, with a billboard. On searching, I found that maybe that was the mall or complex.  Its name was **Deloitte** and on the board, **`Hyundai`** was written.   
<img width="311" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/87023810-5f9b-4773-8900-2892c4c2bb35" />   
<img width="385" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5bbeca4-ed1f-4864-8360-0da04d43712a" />   

I rechecked on Google at this site https://parkplus.io/car-news/hyundai-indias-2024-spotlight-concerts-a-musical-treat-for-customers about the concert details and that whether it was organized by Hyundai.  
<img width="626" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ba471d9b-cb03-4bf2-9815-d8055993eb93" />   

So the bill board name was **`Hyundai`**.  

Next, for the group name, in the same site I found out that **Shankar Ehsaan Loy** has performed on that date.  
>Shankar Ehsaan Loy will return to the stage in Bangalore on October 26...
<img width="823" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a08b57c-485f-46a6-9510-be8d071a71b5" />

So the group name was **`Shankar_Ehsaan_Loy`**.  

Next coming to final part, which was the venue of the performance.  
As can be seen in the image, the venue was **`KTPO`**.  

So the final flag became:  
**`nite{Hyundai,Shankar_Ehsaan_Loy,KTPO}`**
