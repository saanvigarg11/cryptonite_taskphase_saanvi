**OPSEC**: It stands for **Operational Security**.  
It is a set of principles which are used in order to protect the security of an operator or operation. It helps in 
**identifying and protecting senstive info from malicious websites**, ads, etc. This can be done using code names, 
strong, unique passwords, VPN while using Wi-Fi, etc.  

In this challenge, we are basically dealing with a YouTube to mp3 or mp4 converter website, which not only downloads
the required song file, but with that some other suspicious files.
